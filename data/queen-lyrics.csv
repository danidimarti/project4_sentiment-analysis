Taking off

[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
Well, I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you, “Be a superstar”
But I tell you, just be satisfied and stay right where you are
[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Yeah), keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and-a money, honey, you'll survive
[Verse 2]
Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (come on), keep yourself alive
You take your time and take my money, keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive (come on), keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive (come on, come on), keep yourself alive

Born on the twenty-first of May
Died, syphilis, forty-four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes, he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

[Chorus]

Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

Now hear this

[Verse 2]
Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg? Will I borrow?
I don't care, I don't care (anyway)
Come on, come on, the time is right
The man is evil and that is right

[Bridge 1]
Now listen, all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don't listen to what Mama says
Not a word, not a word Mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival (sure)
The great Lord, before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said ""You're going to realize tomorrow""

[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge 2]
No, I'm not gonna tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come, come on, the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before

Oh-oh, the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh-oh, the night comes down
Ooh, and it's dark again

Once I could see the good in me
The black and the white distinctively
Colouring, holding the world inside
Now all the world is grey to me
Nobody can see
You gotta believe it

[Verse 1]
In the year of '39 assembled here, the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day, and the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day, and they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weight
For the Earth is old and grey
Little darling, we'll away but my love this cannot be
For so many years are gone
Though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

Seaside, whenever you stroll along with me
I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside
Meanwhile, I ask you to be my Clementine
You say you will if you could, but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand new angle, highly commendable

[Verse 2]
I feel so romantic, can we do it again?
Can we do it again sometime? (Ooh, I'd like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season

Oh-oh, people of the earth
""Listen to the warning,"" the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man!

[Verse 1]
I dreamed I saw, on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves

[Pre-Chorus]
""I see no day,"" I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal

[Chorus]

Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time

It's the sad-eyed goodbye
Yesterday moments I remember
It's the bleak street, weak-kneed
Partings I recall

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the mistier mist, the hazier days
The brighter sun and the easier lays

[Chorus]
There's all the more reason
For laughing and crying
When you're younger
And life isn't too hard at all

[Verse 2]
It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings to waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle-aged years

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero, it all turns to zero
You might also like[Chorus]
And there's all the more reason
For living or dying
When you're young
And your troubles are all very small

[Bridge]
Out here on the street, we'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet
And half of the time we'd broaden our minds more
In the pool hall than we did in the school hall
With the downtown chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife, the lights and the fun

[Verse 3]
Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain’t easy for a smalltown boy
It ain’t easy at all

[Outro]
Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for breakfast, I guess
I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Oh no, Jimi Hendrix, he was good
Let's try William the Conqueror
Now who else do I like?

Be not gone

They took me to a room without a table
They said ""blow your trumpet into here""
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year

[Verse 3]
I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a-missin'
All the people wanna listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man

[Chorus]
And I was sleepin' like a princess
Never touch the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home
Have to have some fun

[Bridge]
Now they tell me
That I ain’t so fashion-able
And that I owe the man
A million bucks a year
So I told 'em
Where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here, yeah
Back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game

Rollin' down the road

And I sure do wanna go home

I make it half past six, you come at seven
Always try to keep me hanging round
You little spoilt thing
Girl, you kept me waiting
Never contemplating my point of view

[Chorus]
This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool for I believed your lies
But now I've seen through your disguise
Who needs, well, I don't need
Who needs you?

[Verse 2]
Oh, I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
But you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding
Lying flat on your face
Reaching out reaching out
For a helping hand
(Where is that helping hand?)

Well, I don't need you

[Verse 3]
How I was pushed around
Don't let it get you down
You walked all over me
But don't you ever give in
Taking one step forward
Slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling
That you can't forget
Reaching out for a helping hand

[Verse 4]
When I met you
You were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine
You were, oh, so, so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say

[Chorus]
I had to swallow my pride
So naïve you took me for a ride
But now I'm the one to decide
Who needs, well, I don't need
Who needs you?

[Scene 1]
You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candlelight
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

[Chorus]
(It's late) When I'm bleeding deep inside
(It's late) Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
(Too late) Even now
The feeling seems to steal away
(So late) Though I'm crying
I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

[Scene 2]
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time, the more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true

Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you

With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?

If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh, you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

(It's late) Ooh yes, I know
But there's no way it has to be

When I was young
And just getting started
And people talked to me
They sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my 'magination

Some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed
Was some love and affection

That we're all searching for?
There's nothing in this world
To be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good
Some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy
Someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness of love
Wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse
So let's make the best
Of the rest of our years

Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love

Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for

Caring about ourselves

It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair

How I loved you, how I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham, it seems
The years belie, we lived a lie
I love you 'til I die
[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home

[Verse 2]
The slate will soon be clean
I’ll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted, all that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I am cold inside
I have no real intent

[Verse 1]
Oh, how wrong can you be?
Oh, to fall in love
Was my very first mistake
How was I to know
I was far too much in love to see?
Oh, jealousy, look at me now
Jealousy, you got me somehow
You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise
Jealousy, you led me on
You couldn't lose, you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail

[Chorus]
How, how, how, oh my jealousy
I wasn't man enough
To let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy

[Verse 2]
Oh, how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see
Just what you do to me
Oh, jealousy, you tripped me up
Jealousy, you brought me down
You bring me sorrow, you cause me pain
Jealousy, when will you let go?
Got a hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous kind

If I should live or die

Monday
Start of my holiday
Freedom for just one week
Feels good to get away

Tuesday
Saw her down on the beach
I stood and watched a while
And she looked and smiled at me

Wednesday, I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday
My luck had changed
She stood there all alone
I went and asked her name

I never thought that this
Could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more
For memories to fade
